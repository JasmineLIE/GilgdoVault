# 0. Critical Analyses
This vault, or better yet bundle of online notes (See [Wemigwans](https://cjc.utpjournals.press/doi/10.22230/cjc.2020v45n1a3683) regarding the beautiful idea of the digital bundle - I wish I had seen it before I started this work), is a summary and analysis of six pedagogical technologies and/or of Indigenous HCI projects that are demonstrative of current state-of-the-art from a curated reading list. These analyses are being deployed via an Obsidian vault as it allows for easily making connections between sources and developing new relationships between sources and ideas. The resource makes available various "case studies‚Äù for others in various communities and serves as a resource for those who work in Indigenous education or science education. It will hopefully support those who are looking to build a program that will integrate Indigenous and Western science norms in a co-responsive and respectful way. Examples of the intended audience are Indigenous education leaders, teachers, school board administrators, policy makers, Indigenous community members etc.

The six areas of critical analysis that were initially chosen are:
[[1. Introduction to HCI disruption]]
[[2. Transforming educational practice]]
[[3. Colonial STEM education issues]]
[[4. Sociotechnical impacts of digital affordances on Indigenous community]]
[[5. Indigenous responses to and uses of digital tools]]
[[6. Revisioning how we teach CS and digital technologies]]
